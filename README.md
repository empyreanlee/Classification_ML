# Machine Learning
This repository is directed towards machine learning in python with focus on supervised and unsupervised learning.
The first code "magic-gamma" tackles classification models and algorithms
The second file "SeoulBikeRegression" takes on linear regression techniques
Neural Networks models are used effectively in both ML categories
