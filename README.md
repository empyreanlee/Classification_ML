# Machine Learning
This repository is directed towards machine learning in python with focus on supervised and unsupervised learning.
The first code "magic-gamma" tackles classification models and algorithms
The second file "SeoulBikeRegression" takes on linear regression techniques
Neural Networks models are used effectively in both ML categories.
The third file "seed_unsupervised" approaches unsupervised learning using clustering models and PCA model

## Data Sources

I utilized datasets from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository]((https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets)) in our project. The following UCI datasets were used:

1. **MAGIC Gamma Telescope**
   - Description: Data are MC generated to simulate registration of high energy gamma particles in an atmospheric Cherenkov telescope
   - Source: [UCI MAGIC Gamma Telescope Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/159/magic+gamma+telescope)

2. **Seoul Bike Sharing Demand**
   - Description: The dataset contains count of public bicycles rented per hour in the Seoul Bike Sharing System, with corresponding weather data and holiday information.

3. **seeds**
   - Measurements of geometrical properties of kernels belonging to three different varieties of wheat. A soft X-ray technique and GRAINS package were used to construct all seven, real- 
     valued attributes.
